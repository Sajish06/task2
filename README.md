# ðŸ§  Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to discover key patterns, visualize distributions, and identify correlations.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Google Colab  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

## ðŸªœ Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset from Kaggle link  
2. Checked dataset info, shape, and missing values  
3. Computed summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)  
4. Created histograms, boxplots, and pairplots  
5. Generated correlation matrix and heatmap  
6. Analyzed categorical vs. target relationships  
7. Calculated skewness and multicollinearity  
8. Derived visual insights about survival trends  

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- Younger passengers had higher survival rate  
- Females and 1st-class passengers survived more  
- `Fare` is right-skewed; may need log transform later  
- `Pclass` and `Fare` are negatively correlated

  
## ðŸ§© How to Run
1. Open `titanic_eda.ipynb` in Google Colab  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. View plots and summaries inline
